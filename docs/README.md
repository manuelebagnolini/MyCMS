If you are reading a non-English translation of this document you will find a
number of English words that are programming concepts. If these were translated
to other languages there would be a lack of consistency and fluency when reading
about them. In many cases you will find the literal translation followed by the
English term in parenthesis `()`. For example: Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
