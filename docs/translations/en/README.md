# MyCMS Handbook

This handbook is divided into two parts:

- [User Handbook](user-handbook.md) - How to setup/configure MyCMS and more.
- [APIs Handbook](api-handbook.md) - How to use MyCMS APIs to connect a custom front-end.

If you are reading a non-english translation of this handbook you may still find
english sections that have not yet been translated. You
will find a number of english words that are programming concepts. If these were
translated to other languages there would be a lack of consistency and fluency
when reading about them. In many cases you will find the literal translation
followed by the english term in parenthesis `()`. For example: Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs).
